## Description

For project 2 of the UM Coding Bootcamp, I had to create a web application using backend api routes, server, and database. I also had to incorporate a user-friendly mobile responsive frontend using handlebars, home routes, and JavaScript. Password encryption was required to successfully store a user to the database. We incorporated new CSS framework, Tailwind, to style the frontend.
